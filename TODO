This is LibGTop 0.29.0,

a pre-stable version that is basically a feature-freeze for the C language
part except for things that are marked with (***).

You need to use the latest version of LibGTop from CVS for Gnome, it will
no longer work with older releases.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things that need to be implemented before Dec 15 (***):
======================================================

* [More or less important]: Add a better error handling; the _init_XXX_s ()
  functions set the features that are supported on the current system,
  it if fails to get on of them this is most likely an error (/proc not
  mounted).

Things that need to be done before Dec 15:
============================================

* [IMPORTANT] Add `netload' and `ppp' with modems for Linux.

* [IMPORTANT] Check with Linux on 32 and 64 machines !
              (we have one at the university, so I can do this)

* [IMPORTANT] Check whether the daemon works on all supported systems
              and has all features the server has.

* NetBSD/OpenBSD: Support was added on Dec 6, but we need to check
  whether all data are valid (I'll do this next week).

Guile-Port:
===========

* Guile-Port: Add glibtop_sysdeps (), glibtop_get/set_parameter () etc.

Perl-Port:
=========

* Either make it work or put it out of the normal build process.

Things that need to be done before Gnome 1.0:
============================================

* kernel, sysdeps/kernel: Make it work with the latest modifications.

* Add sysdeps code for Solaris (anybody out there who can do this ?)
