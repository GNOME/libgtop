===========

* we have now 'const char *glibtop_types_* []' consisting
  of the C types of the corresponding files of '_glibtop_*'.

* added guile function '(glibtop-types-*)' and '(glibtop-descriptions-*)'.

May/10/1998
===========

* Port to DEC OSF1 3.0 has been made:

  cpu		(total, user, nice, sys, idle)
  mem		(total, used, free)

  loadavg	(loadavg)
  uptime	(uptime)

  msg_limits	(map, max, mnb, mni, tql)
  sem_limits	(mni, msl, opm, vmx, aem)
  shm_limits	(max, min, mni, seg)

  The following need the server to be SUID root:

  proclist	(total, number, size)
  procdata	(cmd, state, uid, pid, ppid, pgrp, tty, k_flags,
		 session, tpgid, sigignore, sigcatch, signal, nice, 
		 priority, resident, rss, vsize, utime, stime,
		 cutime, cstime, trs, drs)

May/07/1998
===========

* 'flags' member of sysdeps/linux/procdata.c is now
  'unsigned long flags [2]'.

* When we give glibtop_get_procdata () a pid of zero, only
  the flags are returned.

* We now use static constants instead of #defines for sysdeps flags.

May/03/1998
===========

* VPATH-Build now working; sometimes it's necessary to copy
  $(top_srcdir)/po/cat-id-tbl.c to $(top_builddir)/po.

* The library has been tested on the following systems:

  - i686-pc-linux-gnu
  - sparc-sun-sunos4.1.1
  - alpha-dec-osf1 (that's DEC OSF1 3.0 and 3.2)

* Compilation has been tested on the following systems (I have no root
  access there and cannot test the library because of this):

  - sparc-sun-solaris2
  - i386-bsdi

* Does no longer require Gnome.

* Guile-Parts are compiled only if guile can be found.

* Some of the executables are statically linked to copy them more easily
  between machines.

May/02/1998
===========

 * Global changes to the interfaces, all functions except glibtop_open()
   and glibtop_close() that took a server argument have now a '__r' suffix;
   the original name is now a macro that uses glibtop_global_server.

Apr/10/1998
===========
Added new directory sysdeps/guile/names. It is the guile interface
to the gtop_names library found in sysdeps/names. Changed
GLIBTOP_DESCRIPTIONS to GLIBTOP_NAMES and added GLIBTOP_GUILE_NAMES
to the header files.

Apr/09/1998
===========
Added new directories guile and names to sysdeps. In names are
some string constants about the data stored in the structures.
guile is a guile interface for the library. It is used in
examples/third (which has been completely rewritten).
The header files define things from names when GLIBTOP_DESCRIPTIONS
if defined and/or from guile when HAVE_GUILE is defined.

Apr/08/1998
===========

Added guile wrapper for the library (see examples/third).
