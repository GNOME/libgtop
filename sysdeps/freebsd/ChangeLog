2001-10-17  Abel Cheung <maddog@linux.org.hk>

	* Makefile.am: move header to $(includedir)/libgtop-1.0/glibtop.

2001-02-27  Martin Baulig  <baulig@suse.de>

	* netload.c: Comment out the `subnet' field on BSDI; this should
	make it compile. Bug #13345.

	* shm_limits.c, msg_limits.c, sem_limits.c: Applied a patch
	from Rolf Grossmann (grossman@securitas.net) for FreeBSD 4.2.
	Fixes #51334.

2001-02-14  Martin Baulig  <baulig@suse.de>

	* proctime.c (glibtop_get_proc_time_p): Make things work on
	OpenBSD 2.6; this is basically the same than on NetBSD.

2000-02-13  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* *.c: kvm_nlist () returns -1 on error, but a positive return value
	does not necessarily mean failure. Fixes #3302 which was reported by
	Matthias Scheler some time ago.

1999-10-16  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	Applied all patches from the FreeBSD 3.3 ports collection.

	* swap.c: Only #include <rlist.h> for __FreeBSD_version < 400005.

	* prockernel.c: Make it compile on FreeBSD / alpha.

	* procsignal.c: Some fixes for FreeBSD-current.

1999-10-16  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* procstate.c (glibtop_get_proc_state_p): Don't use the
	`GLIBTOP_PROCESS_*' constants for process states for
	LibGTop 1.0.x.

1999-07-29  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* proctime.c (glibtop_get_proc_time_p): Fix bug reported by
	Takis Psarogiannakopoulos: `start_time' are seconds since the
 	epoch as it is stated in the manual.

Tue Jun 15 16:04:10 1999 Timur Bakeyev <mc@bat.ru>

	* procuid.c: A fix to a ommitted case, when nor NetBSD, nor  
	LibGTop >= 1.1.0. This should be investigated closely to cover
	more cases....
	
1999-05-26  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	More NetBSD 1.4 fixes.

	* mem.c, procmap.c, procmem.c: Make this work with the new UVM code.

	[FIXME: This following most likely works on all BSD systems, but
	this needs to be tested; I made it conditional to NetBSD 1.4 at
	the moment. Please extend the conditionals to any other systems
	where this works ...]
	
	* procstate.c: Added `ruid' and `rgid' for LibGTop >= 1.1.0.
	* procuid.c: Added `ngroups' and `groups' for LibGTop >= 1.1.0.

1999-05-25  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* ppp.c: Make this work on NetBSD.

Thu Apr  8 23:47:29 1999  Timur Bakeyev  <timur@gnu.org>

 	* cpu.c, mem.c, netload.c, procargs.c, procstate.c, proctime.c,
 	sem_limits.c, shm_limits.c, swap.c: Added initial port for BSD/OS
	(aka BSDI) 2.x and 3.x. 4.x should also(?) work.
	
	Still, this port require more close look and extended check.

1999-03-19  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	Added basic support for BSDI. It compiles without problems on
	BSDI 2.1 and 3.1, but it is *untested* - I'm neither root on
	the machine nor have I access to /dev/kmem, so I don't know
	whether it will work.

	You need to give configure the `--enable-hacker-mode' parameter
	to use the code.

	If someone can verify whether it actually works, please let me
	know.

1999-03-18  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* ppp.c: Don't use `sppp.pp_phase' if we don't HAVE_I4B_ACCT.
	This is an ugly hack until someone tells me which versions have
	this field and which not.

1999-02-25  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* prockernel.c, proctime.c: Applied patch Stanislav Grozev for
	OpenBSD: only include <osreldate.h> for FreeBSD.

1999-02-24  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* swap.c: Applied another patch from Jeremy Lea to
	make it work with FreeBSD-current.

1999-02-21  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* procmap.c, procmem.c: Applied patch from Jeremy Lea.

	* prockernel.c, proctime.c: Applied patch from the FreeBSD 2.2.8
	ports collection.
	
	* procsignal.c: Applied patch from the NetBSD-current ports
	collection.

1998-12-06  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* Make it work with OpenBSD 2.4.

1998-12-05  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* Make it work with NetBSD 1.3.2.

1998-11-17  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* Make it work with FreeBSD 3.0.
 
1998-11-11  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* *.c: It does not work to get information about the swapper task
	on FreeBSD 2.2.6, so we simple return if pid == 0.

1998-10-31  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* *.c: Use glibtop_warn_io_r () instead of glibtop_error_io_r ().

	* proctime.c, prockernel.c, procargs.c: Don't call kvm_uread () if
	the /proc filesystem is not mounted.

1998-10-26  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* netload.c: New file to get network load.

1998-10-26  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* procargs.c: New file to get command line arguments.

1998-10-25  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* ppp.c: New file to get PPP/ISDN statistics. Currently this only
	get ISDN statistics if you have the I4B package.

	To get the number of bytes transferred in/out you need to read the
	file `misc/i4b_acct.txt' in the LibGTop source directory to see
	how to enable this.

1998-10-03  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* procstate.c (glibtop_get_procstate_s): Use correct values for
	the `state' field.
	
	* proclist.c (glibtop_get_proclist_p): Honor the GLIBTOP_EXCLUDE_IDLE
	and GLIBTOP_EXCLUDE_SYSTEM flags of the `which' parameter.

1998-08-24  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* *.c (glibtop_init_p): Using correct `(1 << GLIBTOP_SYSDPES_*)'.
	* cpu.c, mem.c: Removed `const' from sysctl () constants to keep
	compiler happy.

	* procmem.c:  Added missing call to `glibtop_init_p'.

	* prockernel.c: Casting `nwchan' to `unsigned long' since this
	normally has the same size than a pointer. Well, is there a
	FreeBSD for 64bit architectures ?

1998-08-08  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* swap.c: Added swap usage based upton the source code
	of `pinfo'.

1998-08-07  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* *: Imported FreeBSD port of libgtop from Josh Sled.

	* ChangeLog: New file.
