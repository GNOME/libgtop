This is the *development* branch of LibGTop. It is indended
for people who want to help with the development of LibGTop and
not for end-users.

Please use the LIBGTOP_STABLE_1_0 branch (which is LibGTop 1.0.x)
unless you're really a developer.

If you're using LibGTop from CVS simply do a

	cvs update -r LIBGTOP_STABLE_1_0

to get the latest version from the stable branch.

However, I'll periodically make snapshot releases from the development
branch for Solaris users of LibGTop.

They can be found at

	ftp://ftp.home-of-linux.org/pub/libgtop/1.1/

in near future.

Using released tarballs from the development branch is a lot better than
compiling directly from CVS since things in CVS may not always work as
expected.

Note that releases from the developer branch are neither binary
nor fully source compatible; you'll normally have to recompile
everything that use them.
