	* *.c (glibtop_init_p): Using correct `(1 << GLIBTOP_SYSDPES_*)'.
	* cpu.c, mem.c: Removed `const' from sysctl () constants to keep
	compiler happy.

	* procmem.c:  Added missing call to `glibtop_init_p'.

	* prockernel.c: Casting `nwchan' to `unsigned long' since this
	normally has the same size than a pointer. Well, is there a
	FreeBSD for 64bit architectures ?

	* swap.c: Added swap usage based upton the source code
	of `pinfo'.
