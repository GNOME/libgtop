Hello translators,

I'm currently doing larger interface changes in the HEAD of LibGTop
which means that things will change very often here while the whole
module is unstable and unusable for the end-user.

So please don't waste your time doing any translations in the HEAD
at the moment. If you want to do translations, please use the
`LIBGTOP_1_1_2_PATCHES' branch.
