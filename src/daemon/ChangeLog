	* Makefile.am: Added $(GLIB_LIBS) to libs.  Not sure
	how it ever built without it.

	* Makefile.am: Added a notice that this file *requires*
 	libtool 1.2. It may work with 1.1 as well, but that's untested.

	* Makefile.am (install-exec-hook): Always run `libgtop_postinstall',
	it's `:' if there's nothing to do since the empty string is no
	valid shell syntax here.

	* Makefile.am (install-exec-hook): Use `libgtop_postinstall'
	here to make the server suid root or sgid kmem if required.

	* daemon.h (handle_parent_connection): Added prototype.
	* write.c, io.c: Added cast to `const void *' in calls to

	* gnuserv.c (handle_signal): Declared static.
	(main): Casting return value of `getuid' to `int' in
	debugging statement.

	* ChangeLog: New file.
