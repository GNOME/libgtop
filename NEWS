July 19, 2004: Overview of Changes from 2.6.1 to 2.7.4
======================================================
* Plenty of code cleanups. Uninlined a lot of functions. ~5-10KB object size
  reduction.
* Glibify a bit more.
* API changes:
 - glibtop_fsusage provides total read and writes since boot_time.
 - glibtop_netload provides hardware address. IPv6 enable.
 - Added glibtop_get_proc_argv.

Work in progress :
* Finish glibtop_fsusage implementation for Linux.
* Some fuctions don't conform to the documentation, e.g. proctime.

March 11, 2004:
===============

* Released LibGTop 2.5.99 "Gross Work", dedicated to people who do push-ups
  in the loos.

  - plenty of code cleanups

  - removed the dependency on libgnome, only glib required now

  - Linux 2.6 support, NetBSD support and better FreeBSD support

  - Make the block size available for filesystem statistics

February 27, 2001:
=================

* Released LibGTop 1.0.12 "Gerolzhofen".

  - fix for Solaris 8 from Laszlo PETER (msg_limits, sem_limits).

  - fix for FreeBSD 4.2 from Rolf Grossmann (FreeBSD now uses
    `_KERNEL' instead of `KERNEL'). Bug #51334.

  - for BSDI, comment out `subnet' field in netload; this should make
    it compile, but there may be other problems. Bug #13345.

  This release is for GNOME 1.4 Beta2.
