# In México, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Peru
# and El Salvador, Number formats are the same as in the US, so no
# translation is required for them.
# But the msgstr MUST be filled; otherwise it will default to es.po
# which uses different, non US, format for numbers.
# On the other hand, strings that are the same here and in es.po can
# be left out.
