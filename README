Hi all,

[PLEASE READ THE FILE ``README.LATEST'' FOR LATEST NEWS]

this is the latest alpha version of libgtop, a library that fetches
information about the running system such as cpu and memory usage,
active processes etc. On Linux systems, these information are taken
directly from the /proc filesystem. For other systems such as Solaris,
where such programs need to be suid root (or only setgid kmem/mem on
some systems), it provides a suid/setgid server that fetches those
information and a client-side library that talks to this server.

Main idea was to have the same interface for all operating systems,
thus all system dependent details are hidden in the implementation
of that server.

Currently, it only works for Linux, documentation on how to port it
to other systems is on the way. I'm planning to keep this site an
up-to-date mirror of my local machine (which is connected to the
internet over some expensive dialup connection, so I'll upload it about
once every day I made significant changes) so that you can always find
the latest version of the software here.

I've written a simple guile interface for the library to show which
information it can already fetch. See examples/third for details.
