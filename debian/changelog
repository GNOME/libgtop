libgtop (1.0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * New upstream source (1.0.7 "Copenhagen" release)
  * Non-maintainer upload; since I'm not a Debian maintainer, this is some
    kind of "unofficial" debian package for LibGTop 1.0.7 - but I think it
    can be considered stable and working.

libgtop (0.26.2-3.1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Upload to frozen, corrects Bug #29110, Bug #29111, which were
    already fixed.
  * Noticed that guile option is no longer being used, so I removed
    the dependency.
  * Added changelog (to fix lintian error).
  * Changed control file to use macro substitutions.  This is a much
    less error-prone way of building dependencies than doing them by
    hand.
  * Added -V option to dh_makeshlibs to put version number on shlibs
    file.
  * Added shlibs.local file with null entry for "libgtop 1" (and
    others) so libgtop1 doesn't declare a relationship on itself.
