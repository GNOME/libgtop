This is LibGTop 0.29.1,

a pre-stable version representing a feature freeze of both the C and
Guile language parts of LibGTop.

You need to use the latest version of LibGTop from CVS for Gnome, it will
no longer work with older releases.

Things that need to be done before Dec 15:
==========================================

* [IMPORTANT] Add `netload' and `ppp' with modems for Linux.

* [IMPORTANT] Check with Linux on 32 and 64 machines !
              (we have one at the university, so I can do this)

* [IMPORTANT] Check whether the daemon works on all supported systems
              and has all features the server has.

* NetBSD/OpenBSD: Support was added on Dec 6, but we need to check
  whether all data are valid (I'll do this next week).

* inodedb: Poptify, add better user interface; chage configure.in so
           it will only be built if necessary (if invoked without the
           --with(out)-libgtop-inodedb parameter)

Sysdeps directory 'linux':
==========================

* Add implementation `netload' and `ppp' with modems.

* Add implementation for `proc_args'.

Sysdeps directory 'freebsd':
============================

* FreeBSD 3.0: It works fine on this system, so please make sure not
               to break it here.

* FreeBSD 2.2: Make sure it still works here.

* NetBSD/OpenBSD: Support was added on Dec 6, but we need to check
                  whether all data are valid.

Sysdeps directories 'kernel', 'osf1' and 'sun4':
================================================

* You need to use the `--enable-hacker-mode' parameter to configure
  to build this directories.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everything except sysdeps directories:
======================================

* Ready for Gnome 1.0. [ALREADY FEATURE FREEZED]

Guile-Port:
===========

* Ready for Gnome 1.0. [ALREADY FEATURE FREEZED]

Perl-Port:
