	* internals.texi: For LibGTop 1.0.x, we put a short notice here
	that this section was added in the development versions.

1999-10-18  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* about.texi: Added a note about LibGTop and GNOME.

	* reference.texi (glibtop_proc_state): Fix description of the `state'
 	field for LibGTop 1.0.x.

1999-09-29  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* Makefile.am: Reverted Timur's commit.
	(MAKEINFO): Add `-I @libgtop_top_builddir@/doc' here. This still
	creates libgtop.info in srcdir, but that's an automake problem.

Tue Jun 15 15:59:50 1999 Timur Bakeyev <mc@bat.ru>

	* Makefile.am: Force `auto-macros.texi' to be created in $(srcdir),
	as, otherwise, makeinfo is unable to find it, if srcdir != builddir.
	That's a buggy solution, as spoils srcdir, but, as libgtop.info also
	created in srcdir - this is acceptable. Both SHOULD be fixed!

1999-05-28  Martin Baulig  <baulig@Stud.Informatik.Uni-Trier.DE>

	* internals.texi: New file documenting LibGTop internals.
	* reference.texi: Started to document all library functions and
	finished the sysdeps and common references.

1999-05-16  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* main.texi: This is now the main file which will @include all
	chapter files so we can use `texinfo-multiple-files-update'.

	* reference.texi: Added all missing sections with a "not yet written"
	notice.

1999-05-16  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* white-paper.texi: Initial version of the LibGTop White Paper.

	* Makefile.am: Create `auto-macros.texi' from `auto-macros.texi.in'
 	which will contain some `@set' commands for the LibGTop version etc.

	* auto-macros.texi.in: New file. This is a template for
	`auto-macros.texi' which will be automatically generated.

1999-05-09  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* about.texi: Split the `libgtop.texi' into one file pro chapter,
	this is the "About LibGTop".

	* reference.texi: The "LibGTop Reference Manual".

	* libgtop.texi: Initial version of the new LibGTop Manual.
