This is LibGTop 0.30.0,

a feature-freezed version of LibGTop for GNOME 1.0.

You need to use the latest version of LibGTop from CVS for Gnome, it will
no longer work with older releases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:  LibGTop is already feature-freezed for GNOME 1.0, so only bug fixes
       are ok, no API changes !

Sysdeps directory 'linux':
==========================

* Add implementation `netload' and `ppp' with modems.

* Add implementation for `proc_args'.

Sysdeps directory 'freebsd':
============================

* FreeBSD 3.0: It works fine on this system, so please make sure not
               to break it here.

* FreeBSD 2.2: Make sure it still works here.

* NetBSD/OpenBSD: Support was added on Dec 6, but we need to check
                  whether all data are valid.

Sysdeps directories 'kernel', 'osf1' and 'sun4':
================================================

* You need to use the `--enable-hacker-mode' parameter to configure
  to build this directories.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everything except sysdeps directories:
======================================

* Ready for Gnome 1.0. [ALREADY FEATURE FREEZED]
