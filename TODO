This is just a short list for me so I know what I have to do
before I can make the next release.

* Add `netload' and `ppp' with modems for Linux.

* Signals: Does this work now (Matthias Scheler reported problems
  with NetBSD).

* Check error handling (partially done).

* Fix the daemon, some new features were added to the server but
  not to the daemon. Check if it really works also 32 <-> 64 bit.

* Guile-Port: Add glibtop_sysdeps (), glibtop_get/set_parameter () etc.

* Guile-Port: Provide some way to use multiple servers (with #f for
  to global server). Low priority.

* kernel, sysdeps/kernel: Make it work with the latest modifications.
  Very low priority. Perhaps not for this release.
