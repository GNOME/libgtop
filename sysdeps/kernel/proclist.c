 * The interface of this function is a little bit different from the others:
 * buf->flags is only set if the call succeeded, in this case pids_chain,
 * a list of the pids of all currently running processes is returned,
 * buf->number is the number of elements of this list and buf->size is
 * the size of one single element (sizeof (unsigned)). The total size is
 * stored in buf->total.
 *
 * The calling function has to free the memory to which a pointer is returned.
 *
 * On error, NULL is returned and buf->flags is zero. */
