This is a new system call `table ()' for the Linux table. It is faster
than reading from /proc and can be used to fetch all information required
for libgtop until whe have some other function (extended sysctl, ...) in
standard kernels.

I didn't want to change sysctl or some other function myself cause this may
cause other applications relying upon those function to fail. This is
something for the ``real'' kernel gurus ...

To use this new system call for libgtop, do the following:

* Copy this directory to /usr/src/linux/table
* Make /usr/src/linux/include/linux/table.h symlink to /usr/src/linux/table/table.h
* Apply the patch `kernel.patch' to the kernel, compile, install and reboot
* Recompile libgtop (remove `config.cache' and run the `autogen.sh' again).

If you want to change and/or add something - feel free to do so !

Have fun,

Martin
